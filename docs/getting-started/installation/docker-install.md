# üê≥ Docker Install

{% hint style="danger" %}
Docker installation of kaos is **only** available for [**Data Scientists**](../../usage/high-level-usage/#kaos-personas)**.**
{% endhint %}

## Requirements

The kaos command-line utility is used for all interactions. It is lightweight but **requires** the following.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Data Scientist" %}
* [**docker**](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) for isolation of kaos \(system-dependent\)
  * **macOS** ‚Üí `brew install docker`
  * **Linux**    ‚Üí `apt-get install docker`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Installation

kaos supports installation methods based on the desired simplicity and environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the following installation steps assume the kaos repository is accessed by **HTTPS**
{% endhint %}

A **docker** installation of kaos is completed by building the supplied Dockerfile. The following commands will yield a successful **isolated** installation of kaos.

```bash
alias kaos="docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/kaos -e USER=${USER} kilabs/kaos:latest"
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **docker** installation of kaos will **underperform** given the additional isolation "layers" and does not support any [Local](../deploying-infrastructure/#local) clusters.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The default docker installation **only mounts the current directory** - additional volumes can always be included to the kaos alias. See [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) for more information.
{% endhint %}

### Successful Installation

Running `kaos` will greet the user with the following response.
